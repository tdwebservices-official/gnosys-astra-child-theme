# Let’s Install Your Astra Child Theme Now:
Step 1 – Now that you have your child’s theme file, log in to your website Dashboard and navigate to Appearance > Themes > Add New;

Step 2 – Click on the “Upload Theme” (located on the top of the page), choose the .zip file of your child theme, and click on the “Install Now” button;

Step 3 – Activate the Child Theme. Keep in mind that though the Child Theme is the active theme, it can’t work without its parent theme – Astra. Thus, you need to have both themes (Astra theme and your Child theme) installed.
